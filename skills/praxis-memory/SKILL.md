name: praxis-memory
description: This Praxis deployment has a server-side memory of durable org facts (conventions, decisions, people, products, processes). Whenever the user's question may depend on org context, consult memories BEFORE answering — start with `praxis memory recall "<terms>" --json`; if that misses or returns nothing, fall back to `praxis memory list --json` and grep the full dump yourself. Also use `praxis memory add` (after user consent) to persist a new fact the user has just shared.

# Praxis memories

The CLI is yours, not the user's — they will never type these
commands. You shell out via the Bash tool. Output is always JSON.

## Praxis memory vs your native auto-memory — they don't overlap

You may already have a native auto-memory directory (Claude Code
injects `# auto memory` into the system prompt pointing at
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/memory/`). **Praxis memory
does not replace it.** They are different systems for different
kinds of facts, triggered differently:

| | Native auto-memory | Praxis memory |
|---|---|---|
| Lives | locally, on this machine | server-side on the deployment |
| Scope | this user's projects on this laptop | the org's Praxis deployment (visible to other agents / colleagues per audience) |
| Belongs there | personal prefs, working context, ad-hoc observations | org conventions, decisions, people, products, processes, escalation paths |
| Trigger | YOU scoop silently when a durable fact slips by | the USER asks, or you propose and the user confirms |
| Read | auto-loaded at session start | only when you run `praxis memory recall` or `list` |

**Rules:**

1. **A personal preference goes to native auto-memory, not praxis.**
   "I prefer Python" → Write to `~/.claude/projects/<cwd>/memory/`,
   NOT `praxis memory add`. Praxis is for facts that travel with
   the *organization*, not the user's personal context.

2. **An organizational fact goes to praxis, not native auto-memory.**
   "We deploy on Tuesdays" / "Pravanjan owns the data pipeline" →
   `praxis memory add` (with user consent). Native auto-memory
   would silo this knowledge to one laptop.

3. **In doubt: ask the user where it should go.** "Should I remember
   this just for our chats, or save it to the org so other agents
   see it too?" — they'll tell you.

4. **Recall both when relevant.** A question that touches BOTH the
   user's personal context AND org context (e.g. "what's our usual
   deploy day, and what time zone am I in?") might want a praxis
   recall plus a glance at your native `MEMORY.md`. They coexist.

## Two read paths — pick by signal strength

### 1) `praxis memory recall "<query>" --json` (default first move)

Server-side keyword ranking. Fast, narrow, scored. Use when the user's
question has obvious terms likely to appear in memory content.

```bash
praxis memory recall "retry budget for external calls" --json
# → [{slug, title, content, kind, audience, relevance_score, ...}]
```

Top-1 or top-2 is usually enough. Relevance score is Mongo textScore —
it ranks by keyword overlap, not semantics.

### 2) `praxis memory list --json` (fallback when keywords are weak)

Full dump of every memory the caller can see, **content included**.
Parse the JSON yourself — your own semantic judgment is stronger than
Mongo's $text. Use when:

  - `recall` returned nothing useful (zero rows, or scores all low).
  - The user's terms are vague ("when do we usually deploy?") and
    the matching memory might use very different words ("Tuesday
    release window").
  - You want to scan tags or see the breadth of what's stored.

```bash
praxis memory list --json | jq '.[] | select(.tags | index("infra"))'
praxis memory list --json                       # everything
praxis memory list --tag infra --json           # server-side filter
praxis memory list --limit 100 --offset 100 --json   # walk past 100
```

Server caps each page at 100 rows. For larger orgs walk by
`--offset`; in practice most orgs fit in one page.

### When NOT to consult memories

Code-only questions with no org context ("explain this Go function",
"why is this test flaky") do not warrant a recall round-trip.
Memories are about *the organization*, not generic technical help.

## Write path

When the user states an **organizational** fact likely to be useful
in future sessions — a convention, a decision, an escalation path,
who owns what — propose saving it. Get explicit consent ("save this
to org memory?") before running `add`. Personal-context facts
("I prefer Python") belong in your native auto-memory, NOT here
(see "Praxis memory vs your native auto-memory" above).

```bash
praxis memory add \
  --title "Retry budgets" \
  --content "every external call wraps a 3-attempt exponential backoff" \
  --kind feedback \
  --audience user \
  --importance high \
  --tag infra --json
```

Flags:
  --title       human-readable (required)
  --content     the fact body; pass `-` to read from stdin (required)
  --kind        user | feedback | project | reference (mirrors Claude
                auto-memory taxonomy)
  --audience    user (default — the caller's cell across agents)
                | org (org-wide — every user in the org will see it)
  --importance  low | medium | high | critical
  --tag         comma-separated for filtering

Default audience=user is almost always right. Only use audience=org
when the user explicitly says "everyone should see this" or the fact
is obviously org-wide (e.g. "we deploy on Tuesdays" is org-wide;
"my IDE is VS Code" is user-only).

## Output convention

Every command emits JSON unconditionally. The `--json` flag is
accepted for praxis-skill convention compatibility but is a no-op.

## Exit codes

  - `0` ok — proceed
  - `1` generic failure (incl. unexpected HTTP errors)
  - `2` bad command-line args (e.g. missing required --title/--content)
  - `3` auth missing/expired → run `praxis login` and retry
  - `5` network unreachable

## Don'ts

  - **Don't** invent facts and persist them. Only save what the user
    actually said.
  - **Don't** call `add` without explicit user consent. Propose,
    confirm, then run.
  - **Don't** recall on every turn — only when org context is plausibly
    load-bearing for the answer.
  - **Don't** assume recall is exhaustive. If it returns nothing or
    seems off-target, `list` and grep before telling the user "I
    don't know".
  - **Don't** route personal preferences into praxis. "I prefer X"
    goes to your native auto-memory. Praxis is for facts that travel
    with the organization.
