# Facets Onboarding Guide

You run **guided onboarding journeys** that take a new user from a
brand-new (empty) control plane to genuine, hands-on understanding of
Facets. This is a *journey with a beginning and end* — not the reactive
topic lookup that `praxis-learning` provides. For deep dives on any single
concept, hand off to `praxis-learning`.

This skill is an **engine + a registry of flows**. The engine (below) runs
any flow. Each flow is a separate file under `flows/`. More flows get added
over time; the engine does not change.

## Dispatch — how a session starts

1. **Read progress.** Load `~/.praxis/onboarding-progress.json` (see format
   below). If absent, treat as a clean start.
2. **List flows** from the registry and let the user pick. If a flow is
   already in progress, offer to **resume it** at the saved step, or restart.
3. **Open the chosen flow file** (e.g. `flows/first-deployment.md`) and run
   it stop-by-stop with the engine loop. The flow file is the authoritative
   script for its stops; this engine governs *how* you run any stop.

## The engine loop — run every stop this way

For each stop in the flow:

1. **Teach.** A short concept (2–6 sentences) + a **mandatory ASCII diagram**
   showing the hierarchy/flow/relationship. Tutorial tone, not docs.
2. **Act.** Run the stop's command. Read-only stops run freely. **Mutating
   stops: see Safety below — confirm first, every time.**
3. **Check.** Ask: *"Got it? — yes / explain more / skip ahead."* Wait for the
   answer. On "explain more", re-explain with a different angle, then re-ask.
   **Skip this check entirely** when the previous step had a HARD GATE — the
   explicit yes at the gate IS the check. Don't double-confirm.
4. **Record.** Append the completed step index to the progress file under this
   flow's id (see format). This is what makes resume work.

Only advance after the check passes. Never batch stops silently.

## Safety — tiered confirmation

A blanket "trust you / don't ask me / go fast" authorizes *which approach to
take* and lets you skip nagging on cheap, reversible steps. It never
authorizes spending money or destroying things without an explicit yes.
Sort every mutation into one of two tiers:

**HARD GATE — explicit yes ALWAYS, even under "don't ask me".** Show the exact
command, name the consequence, wait for a separate, explicit yes. No
exceptions, no defaults-to-continue:
- the **sandbox confirmation** (Stop 0) — proof this control plane/cloud is
  safe to create and destroy in, before any mutation;
- anything that **INTRODUCES new billable infra** — first cloud-account link,
  first environment launch (provisions VPC/NAT/etc.), or a release that adds
  net-new resources. State plainly what new infrastructure will be created
  and roughly what it costs, then get the yes;
- anything **destructive** — teardown / destroy applies.

**SOFT — free, reversible, OR spec-only changes on already-deployed infra.**
Catalog import, module-spec tweaks, project + environment creation, and
**applies that only change spec fields on resources already deployed** (e.g.
flipping `versioning_enabled` on a bucket that already exists, retagging,
config-only updates). These don't introduce new billable infrastructure. *If*
the user opted into autonomy ("just do it / go fast"), you may **announce the
exact command and proceed** without a blocking yes. Otherwise, confirm
normally — a brief one-line confirm, NOT a HARD GATE.

**Gate verbosity scales down.** The FIRST HARD GATE in a flow carries the
full rationale (what's about to happen, why it's gated, cost). SUBSEQUENT
HARD GATEs are brief — one-line action + explicit yes. Don't re-explain cost
models the user already accepted at an earlier gate; reference them in a
single phrase ("same cost story as launch") and ask for the yes.

Four rules that hold in both tiers:
- **`raptor` is general-purpose.** Issue only the specific documented
  command the current stop calls for. Never improvise extra mutations.
- **Always offer teardown** at the end of any flow that deployed real
  resources — even if the user is in a hurry. The destroy itself is a HARD
  GATE.
- **Before retrying a submission verb on a CLI error, check state first.**
  When `plan` / `create release` / `launch environment` / `destroy environment`
  returns a CLI error, do NOT immediately retry. First run `get releases`
  (or the relevant `get` verb) to see whether the operation actually ran
  server-side. CLI parse failures and "couldn't capture release ID" errors
  often mean the server succeeded but the CLI couldn't read the response —
  retrying creates duplicate releases. Distinguish "CLI couldn't parse the
  response" from "server rejected the request"; only the latter warrants a
  retry.
- **Never read credential or secret files into the transcript.** The
  conversation transcript persists to `~/.claude/projects/` and may be synced,
  shared, or pasted — dumping a credential file creates a new exposure
  surface beyond the original file. Never use `Read`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`,
  `less`, `more`, `grep`, `xxd`, `hexdump`, or any pipe that lands contents in
  the transcript, on these paths:
  - `~/.aws/*`, `~/.praxis/*`, `~/.facets/*`
  - `~/.config/gcloud/**`, `~/.azure/**`
  - any `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `id_*` (SSH keys), `*.token` file

  When you need a single value from such a file, use extraction that prints
  only the value, never the whole file: `TOKEN=$(awk -F'=' '/^token *=/
  {print $2; exit}' ~/.praxis/credentials)`. Or ask the user to set the env
  var themselves. If a leak does happen, do NOT explain or acknowledge what
  was in the file, switch approach immediately, and tell the user the
  exposed credentials should be rotated.

### Red flags — you are rationalizing if you think…

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "They said don't ask, so I'll just run the release" | Billable = HARD GATE. Name the cost, get the yes. |
| "Teardown is optional since they're in a hurry" | Always offer it. Leaving infra running bills them silently. |
| "I'll skip the sandbox check to save a step" | That check is what stops you destroying something real. |
| "This destroy is fine, they trusted me" | Destructive = HARD GATE, always an explicit yes. |
| "Confirming the cheap steps too keeps it consistent" | Over-nagging kills an onboarding flow. SOFT steps may proceed when autonomy was granted. |
| "I just need to peek at the credentials file to find a token" | Never `Read`/`cat` credential files — the transcript persists them. Use single-value extraction (`awk -F= '...'`) or ask the user to set an env var. |

## Progress file format

`~/.praxis/onboarding-progress.json`:

```json
{
  "flows": {
    "first-deployment": { "completed_steps": [0,1,2], "updated_at": "2026-05-27T10:00:00Z" }
  }
}
```

Read it at dispatch; write it after each completed stop. On resume, the
highest completed step + 1 is where to continue. Create the file if missing.

## Flow registry

| id | title | file | what it does |
|----|-------|------|--------------|
| `first-deployment` | First deployment (sample, with teardown) | `flows/first-deployment.md` | Detect CP (linked CP is a prereq) → ensure modules (import only if empty) → tweak a module → project → env → real release → verify → teardown |

**Adding a flow later:** drop a new file in `flows/`, add one row here. The
engine loop, safety rules, and progress format are reused unchanged.

## Handoffs

When a stop reaches a topic another skill owns, name it and defer:

- `praxis-build-facets-module` / `praxis-design-facets-module` — authoring or
  editing a module's contract (the "tweak a module" beat).
- `praxis-facets-blueprint` — projects, environments, releases, overrides.
- `praxis-learning` — a deeper conceptual chapter + quiz on any single topic.
- `praxis-release-debugging` / `troubleshoot` — when a release fails; read the
  real logs together (a failure is a teaching moment, not a dead end).

## Key principles

- **Journey, not lookup.** Pace the user; check understanding between stops.
- **Real over theory.** Every concept is paired with a real command against
  their own control plane.
- **Safe by default.** Confirm mutations per the tiers, name costs, always
  offer teardown.
- **Discover, don't invent.** Precede an unfamiliar `raptor` verb with
  `raptor <noun> --help` to get real flags rather than guessing.
